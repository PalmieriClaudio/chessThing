# chessThing
A JavaScript chess board that eventually will be able to play chess against you.
In this project I hope to eventually build a chessboard that runs some sort of optimized minmax algorithm to play chess.
The main difficulty with the project is that I'm trying to run it entirely in JS (visualizing using the p5.js library), and running a computationally heavy algorithm in javascript can take a very long time.

For now I'll procede to clean and improve the code and then I'll move to different projects, but I plan to eventually come back to this one and finish it.

To play with the project and what it's been built so far, the current version can be found in the gitHub page corresponding to this project. (Here: https://palmiericlaudio.github.io/chessThing/)

I also plan to work on making the project prettier in the next few days.

On a last note, it's still possible to castle through and out of check, even though that's supposed to be illegal, that's something I forgot to add and will add in the near future.
